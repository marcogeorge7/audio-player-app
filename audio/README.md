# Audio Files

This directory contains audio files for the audio player demo.

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Add your own MP3, WAV, or other audio files here
2. Use the Web Audio API tone generator built into the app
3. Download a sample audio file and place it here as `sample.mp3`

The audio player will look for `sample.mp3` by default, but can be configured to use other files.
